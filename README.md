## Project Description
This program implements a command Line Caesar cipher, both encoding and decoding. The key is an integer from 1 to 25. This cipher rotates the letters of the alphabet (A to Z). The encoding replaces each letter with the 1st to 25th next letter in the alphabet (wrapping Z to A). So key 2 encrypts "HI" to "JK", but key 20 encrypts "HI" to "BC". 
This cipher is a substitution mechanism where every plaintext letter is replaced with another letter corresponding to a certain number of letters up or down the alphabet such that the final output cannot be easily deciphered without the key.
